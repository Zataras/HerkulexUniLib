# HerkulexUniLib
Library for testing Herkulex DRS servos with TUI menu and universal communication interface

Some old code from me, I used it to sets if DRS-0602 works propely. I also suceeded to control DRS via ROS node with this lib. 

It can be useful even if it's not well written, because it works while DRS documentation is very poor.
