# HerkulexUniLib
Library for testing Herkulex DRS servos with TUI menu and universal communication interface

Some old code from me, I used it to sets if DRS-0602 works properly. I also suceeded to control DRS as ROS node with this lib on Raspberry Pi. 

It can be useful even if it's not well written, because it works while DRS documentation is very poor.
